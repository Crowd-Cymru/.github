## Funding

- Previously funded by the **National Lottery Heritage Fund**, **National Lottery Players**, and the **National Library of Wales**.  
- Currently funded by the **Welsh Government** until **31 March 2026**.

---

## Background

The idea for the project was born from a need to demonstrate that, as project partners, we were taking a swift, proactive, and collaborative approach to modernise our services to meet the ambitious roadmap of the **Welsh Government’s Digital Strategy for Wales**, which aims to:

> *“improve the lives of everyone through collaboration, innovation and better public services.”*

---

## What we do

We are harnessing the exceptional knowledge of individuals across Wales – and beyond – to help improve the information about our collections.

Using a **bi-lingual online platform** developed by the **National Library of Wales**, we invite volunteers to **tag, index, and transcribe** documents to make them more accessible for researchers.

---

## Impact

- Equipping more people with **digital skills** to stay connected and to use those skills for workplace opportunities and wellbeing.  
- Developing **new models for remote volunteering** that reduce the need to travel, supporting the Welsh Government’s ambition to cut the national carbon footprint.  
- Volunteers are primarily from Wales, but also include participants from **USA, Canada, and Australia**.

## Community

This project has been met, at every request, with offers of help, support, and a true sense of collaboration — supporting individual endeavours for the greater good of the sector.
